At the end of the weekend, we will be showing off your games to the rest of the club!\n\n\"Can I pick my own team?\"\n\nOf course! We will be happy to help people who are new to the club find teams as well.\n\n\"Do I have to stay and make my game through the entire weekend? Can I go home and sleep?\"\n\nAlthough some people choose to go hard and jam the entire weekend, there is no obligation to stay there all the time. Feel free to go home and get some sleep if you're feeling beat!\n\n\"What if I don't know Unity very well?\"\n\nNot a problem! All of our officers will be on hand to help you with any issues you might have.
