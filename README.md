# Facebook Event Hub

### Motivation

Here at Michigan State there are quite a few clubs in the CSE department and they're all awesome (WIC, SpartanHackers, ACM, SpartaSoft, MSU Data Science, and even more). But how do you find out about all the events when they're scattered across the Facebook groups?

Well, thanks to the Facebook Graph API, we can just collect all the events and do with them as we please! I decided to make a simple Flask WebApp that could serve up the Events for all the clubs in a clean and efficient manner. 

I'm not a web designer but I think I can find a friend who can help me setup the WebApp to utilize the data to its fullest and provide useful information in fast and pleasant manner.

### Tools Used
